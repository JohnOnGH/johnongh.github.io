    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>And now I'm adding a new line.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>So far this is just some raw HTML and nothing flash in any sense of the word (not that Flash is a thing anymore).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now I'm interested in creating some sort of page structures and something better than just raw HTML presentation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>need some version statement to know when a new page version has loaded</p>
